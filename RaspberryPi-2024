to read values from ADXL372 accelerometer: 
sudo pip3 install spidev
went into raspberry PI configuration and turned on spidev by running "python3 Accelerometer/ADXL372/adxl372_test.py"
in folder sensor-tests

trying to use spidev library for python
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-adxl37x 
sudo apt-get update
Decided to switch to c since python won't be fast enough to read at the frequency we need.
Had ChatGPT generate a script to start reading values. The script is running but not recieving values. Will look more into
how the script is working and what registers it is using.
