to read values from ADXL372 accelerometer: 
sudo pip3 install spidev
went into raspberry PI configuration and turned on spidev by running "python3 Accelerometer/ADXL372/adxl372_test.py"
in folder sensor-tests

trying to use spidev library for python
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-adxl37x 
sudo apt-get update
Decided to switch to c since python won't be fast enough to read at the frequency we need.
Had ChatGPT generate a script to start reading values. The script is running but not recieving values. Will look more into
how the script is working and what registers it is using. 

Feb 5
The python script is receiving (mostly correct) values. Anthony ran Matlab tests to plot the data and found that we have
perfect harmonics in the data. Tried running the c code and didn't get any values. Changed the library to 
https://github.com/LdB-ECM/linux_device_access/blob/master/spi.c (stored in accessLibs) and rewrote the code to use the 
library.

Fixed a bunch of compilation errors in the code written on Feb 5. Then got a seg fault, most likely becuase the library wasn't
being compiled with the c code. Used command "g++ -pthread -shared adxl372_withSPIlib.c accessLibs/spi.c" to compile c code
and library in the same folder

Worked on precompiling the library so we don't have to recompile it each time. Made a .a file following 
https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/cs50/buildlib.html and moved it into ADXL372. Will try to find a way to move it back to
accessLibs without getting errors. Ran command "g++ -pthread adxl372_withSPIlib.c" to compile c code. 
Code ran but the values weren't correct. x was always 160 and y and z 0, and the status register was empty. We switched the order
that x and y were getting read in (in case one reading was messing up others) but recieved the same values. Tried all 4 spi modes
and they returned different values for x but nothing else changed. Settled on mode 2 as detailed in the data sheet.

Worked on reading values from the ADXL1001. 
Setup with DAQ:  (ADXL1001 -> DAQ)
  Vou -> C0
  GND -> AGND
  Vdd -> 5V
Downloaded library from https://mccdaq.github.io/daqhats/install.html#creating-a-c-program but made the library a submodule in
Git. Tried running the sample file (single_value_read) which gave values!
